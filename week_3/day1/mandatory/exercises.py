# üåü Exercise 2 : Dogs
# Instructions
# Create a class called Dog.
# In this class, create an __init__ method that takes two parameters : name and height. This function instantiates two attributes, which values are the parameters.
# Create a method called bark that prints the following string ‚Äú<dog_name> goes woof!‚Äù.
# Create a method called jump that prints the following string ‚Äú<dog_name> jumps <x> cm high!‚Äù. x is the height*2.
# Outside of the class, create an object called davids_dog. His dog‚Äôs name is ‚ÄúRex‚Äù and his height is 50cm.
# Print the details of his dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
# Create an object called sarahs_dog. Her dog‚Äôs name is ‚ÄúTeacup‚Äù and his height is 20cm.
# Print the details of her dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
# Create an if statement outside of the class to check which dog is bigger. Print the name of the bigger dog.

# üåü Exercise 3 : Who‚Äôs The Song Producer?
# Instructions
# Define a class called Song, it will show the lyrics of a song.
# Its __init__() method should have two arguments: self and lyrics (a list).
# Inside your class create a method called sing_me_a_song that prints each element of lyrics on its own line.
# Create an object, for example:
# Then, call the sing_me_a_song method. The output should be:

# Exercise 4 : Afternoon At The Zoo
# Instructions
# Create a class called Zoo.
# In this class create a method __init__ that takes one parameter: zoo_name.
# It instantiates two attributes: animals (an empty list) and name (name of the zoo).
# Create a method called add_animal that takes one parameter new_animal. This method adds the new_animal to the animals list as long as it isn‚Äôt already in the list.
# Create a method called get_animals that prints all the animals of the zoo.
# Create a method called sell_animal that takes one parameter animal_sold. This method removes the animal from the list and of course the animal needs to exist in the list.
# Create a method called sort_animals that sorts the animals alphabetically and groups them together based on their first letter.
# Create a method called get_groups that prints the animal/animals inside each group.

# Create an object called ramat_gan_safari and call all the methods.
